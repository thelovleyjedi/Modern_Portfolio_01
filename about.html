            Hello! My name is Kingsley Lewis. I graduated from DeVry University
            with a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science in 2012. I started out
            in sales and working directly with customers. I eventually secured a
            position at Ryder Logistics as a Logistics Coordinator in 2015. My
            career started off there by building an access database for the
            Richelieu account. The database was linked to an external Excel
            spreadsheet that was extracted from a program Ryder provided. Within
            the access database, I was able to write multiple SQL queries that
            in pulled order numbers, customer names, and shipment orders into an
            Excel file. I then moved on to execution(building,planning,
            tendering loads). The last title I held at Ryder Logistics was the
            White Glove Specialist. The position required company-wide
            high-level tracking and reporting for the Dr.Pepper account. The
            data had to be updated by refreshing it in Tableau and publishing
            it. I continue to keep abreast with technological changes with
            courses on Youtube, Udemy, and W3schools. I honestly want to make a
            career change to help others in a similar situation learn to code
            like me.
